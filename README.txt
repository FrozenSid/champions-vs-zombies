# champions-vs-zombies
A website for a game I plan to develop. The game will be called "Champions VS Zombies".
In order to see the website, do the following:
- download WAMP (for Windows machines), LAMP (for Linux machines), MAMP (for Macintosh machines)
- save all the files here in one folder and name it anything you want (for example, "CvsZ")
- run WAMP/LAMP/MAMP (if the icon is green everything works fine)
- open a web browser and type "localhost:8888/CvsZ" and you will see the website
- 8888 is the port number but for your machine it might be different - it could be 80 or 8080
- Enjoy my website!
